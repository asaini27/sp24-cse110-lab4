1. Line no 12 will print 3, this is because the value of 'i' will get incremented from the for loop. Since the for loop runs uptil the length of price we get 'i' as 3. 
2. This would print 150, this is because of the last iteration of the fpr loop which gives us 150 and then we find that value. 
3. This will also give us the value 150. Again from the for loop we see the final value assigned to 'finalPrice' from the final iteration is 150. 
4. The given function will return an array with the values, [50,100,150]. This is because for the given call the function first reduced the original price by 50% and rounding does not the values we get therefore the array [50,100,150] will be returned. 
5. ReferenceError: i is not defined. This is because of using 'let' after which the 'i' is no longer accessible after the for loop. 
6.
